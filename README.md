# Python and Julia Code for Structural Behavioral Economics

### Introduction:

<div align= "justify"> Here you will find Python and Julia notebooks to replicate the main estimates of several papers in the field of Structural Behavioral Economics.
Python and Julia are two programming languages that offer some perks compared to others often used by economists, since they are: </div>

<br>

1. Free
2. Open source 
3. Fast!

We hope this work could help and ease the transition for future researchers' moving from Stata, R and Matlab to Python and Julia.

### Organization:

<div align= "justify"> The repository is organized as follows. In the main page you will find folders with the name of the authors who wrote the paper, the journal where the
 paper was published and the year of publication. Each folder contains three more folders named: code, input and output. Code contains the notebooks to replicate the main estimates of the 
papers. The Python notebook has file format .IPYNB while the Julia notebook has file format .jl. Input contains all the data used in the notebooks to replicate the estimates. 
Output contains the results obtained running the notebooks in csv file format. </div>

### Papers:

<div align= "justify"> As of right now this repository contains only the notebooks to replicate the aggregate estimates of Bruhin-Fehr-Schunk-JEEA-2019. However, more papers will 
be uploaded soon. We have already written and tested the code for the following papers: </div>

- Frydman-Nunnari-2021: Maximum Likelihood
- Augenblick-Rabin-REStud-2019: Maximum Likelihood (with Bootstrapped standard errors)
- Bruhin-Fehr-Schunk-JEEA-2019: Maximum Likelihood and EM-Algorithm
- DellaVigna-Pope-REStud-2018: GMM (with Bootstrapped standard error) and Non-Linear-Least-Squares
- DellaVigna-List-Malmendier-Rao-REStud-2017: Simulated Method of Moments
